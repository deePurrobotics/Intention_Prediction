abstract="A key technical issue for human intention prediction from observed human actions is how to discover and utilize the spatio-temporal patterns behind those actions. Inspired by the well-known two-stream architecture for action recognition, this paper proposes an approach for human intention prediction based on a two-stream architecture using RGB images and optical flow. Firstly, the action-start frame of each trial of a human action is determined by calculating the L2 distance of the positions of the human joints between frames of the skeleton data. Secondly, a spatial network and a temporal network are trained separately to predict human intentions using RGB images and optical flow, respectively. Both early concatenation fusion methods in the spatial network and sampling methods in the temporal network are optimized based on experiments. Finally, average fusion is used to fuse the prediction results from the spatial network and the temporal network. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a new dataset of human intentions behind human actions is introduced. This dataset contains RGB images, RGB-D images, and skeleton data of human actions of pitching a ball. Experiments show that the proposed approach can predict human intentions behind human actions with a prediction accuracy of 74{\%} on the proposed dataset. The proposed approach is further evaluated on the Intention from Motion (IfM) dataset, a dataset of human intentions behind human actions of grasping a bottle. The proposed approach achieves a prediction accuracy of 77{\%} on the IfM dataset. The proposed approach is effective in predicting human intentions behind human actions in different applications.",
